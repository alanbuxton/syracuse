    ns1:documentExtract "John Adams, Twitter's new Ops Engineer (and apparently a descendant of the guy from the HBO series) , said in a Twitter message today (where else) that he 'll soon be working to \"fix twitter .\" While I 'm guessing that is n't exactly how Twitter would like to have him describe his new job, we wanted to know more. So TechCrunchIT's Steve Gillmor put a camera in his face and made him talk (link to video is here) . Interview above, although he tones down \"fixing twitter\" to \"working with the team to solving their problems\". Good luck John, and thanks for being such a good sport with the interview." ;
